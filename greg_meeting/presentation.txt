lol ok

SO I fell in love with a girl in Cincinnatti and am planning to leave my current position at the end of this summer.
That being said, I would most prefer to stay with this hotel because I really believe in the success of this business.

It's hard not to notice the need for dedicated technical support here at hotel Indy.
Moving forward I would like to present the opportunity to be an ally in that regard.
with Job experience as an IT professional for the city of Denver and relevant certifications (hand the print out now.),
 I feel confident in my ability to succeed at such a role.
